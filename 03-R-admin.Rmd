#  Obtaining R
<p><a href="" id="index-Obtaining-R"></a></p>
<p>Sources, binaries and documentation for R can be obtained via CRAN, the “Comprehensive R Archive Network” whose current members are listed at <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/mirrors.html" class="uri">https://CRAN.R-project.org/mirrors.html</a>.</p>

<h3 id="getting-and-unpacking-the-sources" class="section">1.1 Getting and unpacking the sources</h3>
<p><a href="" id="index-Sources-for-R"></a></p>
<p>The simplest way is to download the most recent R-x.y.z.tar.gz file, and unpack it with</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example1"><code>tar -xf R-x.y.z.tar.gz</code></pre>
</div>
<p>on systems that have a suitable<a href="environment-variable-index.html#FOOT1" id="DOCF1"><sup>1</sup></a> <code class="calibre6">tar</code> installed. On other systems you need to have the <code class="calibre6">gzip</code> program installed, when you can use</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example1"><code>gzip -dc R-x.y.z.tar.gz | tar -xf -</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The pathname of the directory into which the sources are unpacked should not contain spaces, as most <code class="calibre6">make</code> programs (and specifically GNU <code class="calibre6">make</code>) do not expect spaces.</p>
<p>If you want the build to be usable by a group of users, set <code class="calibre6">umask</code> before unpacking so that the files will be readable by the target group (e.g., <code class="calibre6">umask 022</code> to be usable by all users). Keep this setting of <code class="calibre6">umask</code> whilst building and installing.</p>
<p>If you use a recent GNU version of <code class="calibre6">tar</code> and do this as a root account (which on Windows includes accounts with administrator privileges) you may see many warnings about changing ownership. In which case you can use</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example1"><code>tar --no-same-owner -xf R-x.y.z.tar.gz</code></pre>
</div>
<p>and perhaps also include the option --no-same-permissions. <a href="" id="index-TAR_005fOPTIONS"></a> (These options can also be set in the <code class="calibre6">TAR_OPTIONS</code> environment variable: if more than one option is included they should be separated by spaces.)</p>

<h3 id="getting-patched-and-development-versions" class="section">1.2 Getting patched and development versions</h3>
<p>A patched version of the current release, ‘r-patched’, and the current development version, ‘r-devel’, are available as daily tarballs and via access to the R Subversion repository. (For the two weeks prior to the release of a minor (3.x.0) version, ‘r-patched’ tarballs may refer to beta/release candidates of the upcoming release, the patched version of the current release being available via Subversion.)</p>
<p>The tarballs are available from <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R/daily" class="uri">https://stat.ethz.ch/R/daily</a>. Download R-patched.tar.gz or R-devel.tar.gz (or the .tar.bz2 versions) and unpack as described in the previous section. They are built in exactly the same way as distributions of R releases.</p>

<h4 id="using-subversion-and-rsync" class="subsection">1.2.1 Using Subversion and rsync</h4>
<p><a href="" id="index-Subversion"></a></p>
<p>Sources are also available via <a href="https://svn.R-project.org/R/" class="uri">https://svn.R-project.org/R/</a>, the R Subversion repository. If you have a Subversion client (see <a href="https://subversion.apache.org/" class="uri">https://subversion.apache.org/</a>), you can check out and update the current ‘r-devel’ from <a href="https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/" class="uri">https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/</a> and the current ‘r-patched’ from ‘https://svn.r-project.org/R/branches/R-x-y-branch/’ (where x and y are the major and minor number of the current released version of R). E.g., use</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example1"><code>svn checkout https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/ path</code></pre>
</div>
<p>to check out ‘r-devel’ into directory path (which will be created if necessary). The alpha, beta and RC versions of an upcoming x.y.0 release are available from ‘https://svn.r-project.org/R/branches/R-x-y-branch/’ in the four-week period prior to the release.</p>
<p>Note that ‘https:’ is required<a href="environment-variable-index.html#FOOT2" id="DOCF2"><sup>2</sup></a>, and that the SSL certificate for the Subversion server of the R project should be recognized as from a trusted source.</p>
<p>Note that retrieving the sources by e.g. <code class="calibre6">wget -r</code> or <code class="calibre6">svn export</code> from that URL will not work (and will give a error early in the <code class="calibre6">make</code> process): the Subversion information is needed to build R.</p>
<p>The Subversion repository does not contain the current sources for the recommended packages, which can be obtained by <code class="calibre6">rsync</code> or downloaded from CRAN. To use <code class="calibre6">rsync</code> to install the appropriate sources for the recommended packages, run <code class="calibre6">./tools/rsync-recommended</code> from the top-level directory of the R sources.</p>
<p>If downloading manually from CRAN, do ensure that you have the correct versions of the recommended packages: if the number in the file VERSION is ‘x.y.z’ you need to download the contents of ‘https://CRAN.R-project.org/src/contrib/dir’, where dir is ‘x.y.z/Recommended’ for r-devel or x.y-patched/Recommended for r-patched, respectively, to directory src/library/Recommended in the sources you have unpacked. After downloading manually you need to execute <code class="calibre6">tools/link-recommended</code> from the top level of the sources to make the requisite links in src/library/Recommended. A suitable incantation from the top level of the R sources using <code class="calibre6">wget</code> might be (for the correct value of dir)</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example1"><code>wget -r -l1 --no-parent -A\*.gz -nd -P src/library/Recommended \
  https://CRAN.R-project.org/src/contrib/dir
./tools/link-recommended</code></pre>
