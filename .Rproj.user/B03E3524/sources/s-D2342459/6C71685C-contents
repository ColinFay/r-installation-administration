#  Running R
<p>How to start R and what command-line options are available is discussed in <a href="http://colinfay.me/intro-to-r/appendix-b-invoking-r.html">Invoking R</a> in An Introduction to R.</p>
<p>You should ensure that the shell has set adequate resource limits: R expects a stack size of at least 8MB and to be able to open at least 256 file descriptors. (Any modern OS should have default limits at least as large as these, but apparently NetBSD may not. Use the shell command <code class="calibre6">ulimit</code> (<code class="calibre6">sh</code>/<code class="calibre6">bash</code>) or <code class="calibre6">limit</code> (<code class="calibre6">csh</code>/<code class="calibre6">tcsh</code>) to check.)</p>
<p>R makes use of a number of environment variables, the default values of many of which are set in file R_HOME/etc/Renviron (there are none set by default on Windows and hence no such file). These are set at <code class="calibre6">configure</code> time, and you would not normally want to <a href="" id="index-R_005fPAPERSIZE-1"></a> change them – a possible exception is <code class="calibre6">R_PAPERSIZE</code> (see <a href="appendix-b-configuration-on-a-unix-alike.html#Setting-paper-size">Setting paper size</a>). The paper size will be deduced from the ‘LC_PAPER’ locale category if it exists and <code class="calibre6">R_PAPERSIZE</code> is unset, and this will normally produce the right choice from ‘a4’ and ‘letter’ on modern Unix-alikes (but can always be overridden by setting <code class="calibre6">R_PAPERSIZE</code>).</p>
<p>Various environment variables can be set to determine where R creates its per-session temporary directory. The environment variables <a href="" id="index-TMPDIR-2"></a> <a href="" id="index-TMP"></a> <a href="" id="index-TEMP"></a> <code class="calibre6">TMPDIR</code>, <code class="calibre6">TMP</code> and <code class="calibre6">TEMP</code> are searched in turn and the first one which is set and points to a writable area is used. If none do, the final default is /tmp on Unix-alikes and the value of <a href="" id="index-R_005fUSER"></a> <code class="calibre6">R_USER</code> on Windows. The path should be an absolute path not containing spaces (and it is best to avoid non-alphanumeric characters such as <code class="calibre6">+</code>).</p>
<p>Some Unix-alike systems are set up to remove files and directories periodically from /tmp, for example by a <code class="calibre6">cron</code> job <a href="" id="index-TMPDIR-3"></a> running <code class="calibre6">tmpwatch</code>. Set <code class="calibre6">TMPDIR</code> to another directory before starting long-running jobs on such a system.</p>
<p>Note that <code class="calibre6">TMPDIR</code> will be used to execute <code class="calibre6">configure</code> scripts when installing packages, so if /tmp has been mounted as ‘noexec’, <code class="calibre6">TMPDIR</code> needs to be set to a directory from which execution is allowed.</p>
